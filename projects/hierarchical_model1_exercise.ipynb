    "You will be working with the reedfrogs tadpole dataset introduced [here](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1890/04-0535) and analyzed in [Statistical Rethinking 2nd Ed. Chapter 13](https://github.com/pymc-devs/resources/blob/master/Rethinking_2/Chp_13.ipynb).\n",

    "The experiment intended to study how an ecological mechanism called predation-induced hatching, affected the survivability of tadpoles until they morphed into frogs. Predation-induced hatching is a phenomenon in which larvae hatch into tadpoles early to avoid being eaten by acquatic predators. The experiment intended to study if hatching early led to decreased survivability in the long run because the tadpoles would be too small to escape predators.\n",
    "\n",
    "In their experimental setup, they prepared many water tanks, in which they placed different numbers of tadpoles, with different sizes, in the presence or absence of predators and recorded the number of tadpoles that survived until morphed into frogs."

    "You will take the dataset (stored in `\"data/reedfrogs.csv\"`) and will attempt to answer the following questions:\n",

    "1. Does size alone influence survivability (ignoring the presence or absence of predators)?\n",
    "2. Does the presence of predators affect survivability?\n",
    "3. In the presence of predators, does size play an important role in survivability? Attempt to build a model in which size and predation interact to explain survival probability.\n",

    "5. Predict the probability of survival of 100 small tadpoles in a new tank, in the presence of predators, given that 50 of them survived in our experiment"
